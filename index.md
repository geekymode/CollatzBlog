# A Final thought

The Sanskrit script on the library wall helped me discover a loose
connection between three different ancient texts, all centered around
the concept of knowledge. While the Vedas and Upanishads focus on
abstract philosophical ideas, the Gita takes a more practical approach
by offering specific qualities we can develop in everyday life.
Essentially, it provides applied spiritual psychology rather than just
theoretical wisdom. Even as someone who’s agnostic, I found this
fascinating.
